# A little script for Maths315, chapter 2 (or 3)
Calculate the value of a first-order language formula/statement and put brackets into the formula. For example, fxy for x=1 y=2 returns 3 and f(xy). Works with long formula. 

Took 1 hour to make this script to do a 15-minute question in an assignment. Worth it.
